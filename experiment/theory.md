<p>It is simplest form of manometer used for measuring gause pressures. One end of thid manometer is connected to the point where pressure is to be meausred and other end is open to the atmosphere as shown in figure 1. The rise of liquid gives the pressure head at that point. If at a point A, the height of liquid say water is h in piezometer tube, then pressure at A</p>

$$ = \rho \times g \times h \frac{N}{m^2} $$
